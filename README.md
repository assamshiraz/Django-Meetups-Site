# Django Meetups Website 

The Django Meetups Website is a website made for those who wish to streamline booking in-person meetups. 

I applied languages such as CSS, HTML and Python to develop this site. 

However, this site is based on an [academind beginner Django course project]([https://youtu.be/t7DrJqcUviA]) that I completed to develop my skills in software developement; hence, the idea is not originally mine, but this is still my work. 

**FOR THE USER:**

If you'd like to use this application, please download the zip file from the main branch. 

In your command terminal, ensure you are in in the directory: Academind Project Course\academind_course_site

Here, run the following: 

``python manage.py runserver``
