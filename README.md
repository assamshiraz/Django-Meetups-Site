# Django Meetups Website 

The Django Meetups Website is a website made for those who wish to streamline booking in-person meetups. 

This is based on an academind beginner Django course project that I completed to develop my skills in software developement. 

Since this is a project taken on based on an external course, I do not claim ownership of the original idea, nor the code made in this project.
