# Django Meetups Website 

The Django Meetups Website is a website made for those who wish to streamline booking in-person meetups. 

I applied languages such as CSS, HTML and Python to develop this site. 

However, this site is based on an [academind beginner Django course project]([https://youtu.be/t7DrJqcUviA]) that I completed to develop my skills in software developement; hence, the idea is not originally mine, but this is still my work.
